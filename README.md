## Memory Game Project

This is Udacity's second project for Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  A simple memory match game that randomly shuffles cards. 

## How the game works

Click a card to start the game, it also starts timer and move counter. Two cards will flip at a time to check if they match.  When player matched all 8 pairs of cards, a pop up window will appear displaying how many moves you've made, how long it took you to finish and your star rating.
